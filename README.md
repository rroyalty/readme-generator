### Description

This is the 'week 9' homework assignment for UNH Coding Bootcamp. For the assignment, we were tasked with creating a node program that generates READMEs based on user input using the Inquirer package.
  My program allows you to add one part at a time to the various sections of the README file. You can add Paragraphs, Images, or Links.
